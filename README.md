# or3-intern (v1)

Go rewrite of nanobot with SQLite persistence + hybrid long-term memory retrieval.

## Quick start

1) Run guided setup:
```bash
go run ./cmd/or3-intern init
```

2) Start interactive chat:
```bash
go run ./cmd/or3-intern chat
```

3) Or run enabled external channels:
```bash
go run ./cmd/or3-intern serve
```

The `init` command can store your provider settings in `~/.or3-intern/config.json`, so you do not need to manually manage env vars unless you want to.

## Commands

- `or3-intern init` guided first-run setup
- `or3-intern chat` interactive CLI
- `or3-intern serve` run enabled external channels (Telegram / Slack / Discord / WhatsApp bridge)
- `or3-intern agent -m "hello"` one-shot
- `or3-intern migrate-jsonl /path/to/session.jsonl [session_key]`

## Notes

- Uses SQLite with WAL + single-connection for deterministic low-RAM operation.
- History is always fetched with `LIMIT` and never full-scanned.
- Hybrid memory retrieval: pinned + vector (cosine) + FTS keyword search.
- External channels are disabled by default; configure them in `config.json` or via env vars before using `serve`.
- Supported non-CLI channels: Telegram, Slack, Discord, and a local WhatsApp bridge.

## Dependencies

This repo uses external Go modules (SQLite driver + cron parser). If you're building in an offline environment, you must vendor modules ahead of time.
